					<h1>School <span>history</span></h1>
					<p>In 1989, two students, Vaughn Martin and Abednego Mbali Kanyia, were ministering together in Ukunda at the coast of Kenya. One night the Lord spoke to Vaughn and told him to purchase a piece of land at Ukunda. The Lord told Vaughn that one day Kenya would send many missionaries into the nations of the earth and that a missionary training center would be built upon that piece of land. So the land was bought, and many years passed. Vaughn became a missionary in Europe, and Mbali became a businessman. In 2012, while Vaughn was praying in Europe, the Lord confirmed the vision once again and instructed Vaughn to begin the school. Ukunda Missions School opened in September 2013. Kenyan missionaries specializing in Muslim evangelism are now being trained and sent from the school.
